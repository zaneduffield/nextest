versions or to uninstall themselves.  On Unix systems this is a simple feat, but
on Windows a few hacks are needed which is why this crate exists.</p>
<p>This is a useful operation when working with single-executable utilties that
want to implement a form of self updating or self uninstallation.</p>
<h3 id="self-deletion"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#self-deletion">§</a>Self Deletion</h3>
<p>The <a href="fn.self_delete.html" title="fn self_replace::self_delete"><code>self_delete</code></a> function schedules a binary for self deletion.  On Unix the
file system entry is immediately deleted, on Windows the file is deleted after the
process shuts down.  Note that you should not use this function to be followed up
by a replacement operation, for that use <a href="fn.self_replace.html" title="fn self_replace::self_replace"><code>self_replace</code></a> as on Windows the file
will still be locked.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code>self_replace::self_delete()<span class="question-mark">?</span>;</code></pre></div>
<p>On Windows self deletion requires some place in the folder the deletion is taking
place.  This will prevent the abiltiy of the program to also delete the folder the
executable is placed in.  To avoid this you can use the <a href="fn.self_delete_outside_path.html" title="fn self_replace::self_delete_outside_path"><code>self_delete_outside_path</code></a>
function which will ensure that the deletion does not take place in the path
provided if it’s possible to do so.  That way you can delete entire structures safely.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">let </span>itself = std::env::current_exe().unwrap();
<span class="kw">let </span>parent = itself.parent().unwrap();
self_replace::self_delete_outside_path(<span class="kw-2">&amp;</span>parent)<span class="question-mark">?</span>;
fs::remove_dir_all(<span class="kw-2">&amp;</span>parent);</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="self-replacing"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#self-replacing">§</a>Self Replacing</h3>
<p>This replaces the binary with another binary.  The provided path is copied over and
if the function successfully completes, you can delete the source binary.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">use </span>std::fs;

<span class="kw">let </span>new_binary = <span class="string">"/path/to/new/binary"</span>;
self_replace::self_replace(<span class="kw-2">&amp;</span>new_binary)<span class="question-mark">?</span>;
fs::remove_file(<span class="kw-2">&amp;</span>new_binary)<span class="question-mark">?</span>;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="implementation"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#implementation">§</a>Implementation</h3>
<p>The way this is implemented depends on the operating system.  On UNIX systems you
can usually not directly write into an executable, but you can swap it out which is
exactly what this is doing.  For deleting, the file is just unlinked, for replacing
a new file is placed right next to the current executable and an atomic move with
<code>rename</code> is performed.</p>
<p>On Windows the situation is trickier because when an executable launches it can be
renamed, but it cannot be unlinked.  This means that we cannot clean up after
ourselves easily.  In either case, we first move our executable aside so the name
on the file system is made available for the new executable.  Then for both
deleting and replacing, we create a copy of our own executable first.  After this we
open that copied executable with <code>FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code>.  Then we spawn it and
wait for our own shut down.</p>
<p>This library contains a special glue code that detects this copy of the executable
and does nothing else but waiting for the parent to quit and to then delete the
parent executable.  There is an extra hack in there in that it spawns another system
executable that stays alive until after we shut down to make the self deletion of
the copy work.  This is necessary because our running executable must not be the
last user of that file handle as otherwise the deletion won’t work as the
executable still cannot be deleted.  Presumably this is because <code>CreateProcess</code>
and friends do not open the executable with <code>FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Special note on Windows:</strong> the system will attempt to run the parent deletion logic
if the executable has the suffix <code>.__selfdelete__.exe</code>.  This means if you
name your executable <code>foo.exe.__selfdelete__.exe</code>, this logic would kick in.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives-for-windows"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#alternatives-for-windows">§</a>Alternatives for Windows</h3>
<p>Various proposals were made and tried for alternative solutions on Windows.  One
quite popular option is to spawn a batch file for the deletion job as a batch file
can self delete.  This could be used for both replace and self deletion, but it
has the disadvantage that this is a very racy and quite dirty approach as the batch
file cannot easily wait for the shutdown of the parent process.</p>
<p>For just replaces, co-operation between parent and client could be implemented in
simpler terms where first the new executable replaces the old, and then on
startup replaces the new one.  There are two downsides of this approach: the first
is that it requires that the new replacing executable has matching logic for the
cleanup.  The second issue with this approach is that it requires either launching
the new executable or waiting for the executable to launch for natural reasons.
The former might not always be preferrable, the second leaves files lingering
around for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>The third, and somewhat official solution is to use <code>MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT</code>
with <code>MoveFileEx</code>.  This causes windows to store an entry in the registry and
will perform the delete / move on restart.  This means that if a restart of the
machine does not happen, no cleanup is performed.  It also is a privileged
operation that is not available to all user accounts.</p>
<h3 id="limitations"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#limitations">§</a>Limitations</h3>
<p>Because files need to be placed temporarily on the file system, there is a chance
that if power is cut in just the wrong moment, some files are left over.  These
files resemble the original names of the executable prefixed with a dot (<code>.</code>) and
a random suffix.  The likelihood of this happening should be small.  It’s not
recommended to run automatic cleanup on startup as the location of those temporary
files placed is left undefined.  In many cases the temporary files will be placed
in temporary locations and the operating system will take care of the deletion on
restart.</p>
