<p>More accurately, information about Strongly Connected Components with 2 or more elements.
Constructed through <code>PackageGraph::cycles</code>.</p>
<p>This page includes a bunch of detailed information on cycles, but here’s the TLDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, cycles can happen</li>
<li>Cycles only happen with dev-dependencies</li>
<li>These cycles have properties that make them easy to handle</li>
<li>We handle this in APIs like <a href="struct.PackageSet.html#method.packages" title="method guppy::graph::PackageSet::packages"><code>PackageSet::packages</code></a></li>
<li>As a result, you probably don’t actually need this module</li>
</ul>
<p>The slighly more detailed summary is that any graph of “packages” is conflating
the “real” package with its tests, which are actually separate binaries. These
tests <em>always</em> depend on the “real” package, and if we bothered to encode that
then any package with tests would have a cyclic dependency on itself – so we
don’t encode that. Unfortunately dev-dependencies allow tests to <em>indirectly</em>
depend on the “real” package, creating a cycle you <em>do</em> see.</p>
<p>If you only care about “real” builds, you can simply ignore the dev-dependency
edges and restore a nice and simple DAG that can be topologically sorted. This is what
we do for you in APIs like <a href="struct.PackageSet.html#method.packages" title="method guppy::graph::PackageSet::packages"><code>PackageSet::packages</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you care about tests and dev-dependencies, we recommend treating those as
different from the “real” ones (essentially desugarring the package into two nodes).
Because all dev builds are roots of the package graph (nothing depends on a test/benchmark),
they can always go at the start/end (depending on direction) of the topological sort.
This means you can just do add a second loop before/after the “real” one.</p>
<p>For instance, here’s a simple program that recursively computes some property of packages
(here “whether serde is a transitive dependency”):</p>

<h2 id="why-cargo-dependency-graphs-have-cycles"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#why-cargo-dependency-graphs-have-cycles">§</a>Why Cargo Dependency Graphs Have Cycles</h2>
<p>Dependency graphs are generally Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), where each package
is a node and each dependency is an edge. These graphs are acyclic (contain no cycles)
because anything else would be a paradox – how do you build X if it depends on itself?
You don’t!</p>
<p>So why does this API exist? It wouldn’t make sense for Cargo to have cycles!</p>
<p>The problem is that “the Cargo dependency graph” is actually two different graphs
at different levels of abstraction: The Package Graph (Guppy, cargo-metadata), and
The Build Graph (Cargo’s internals). These two graphs are different because each
package is actually a bunch of different
<a href="struct.PackageMetadata.html#method.build_targets" title="method guppy::graph::PackageMetadata::build_targets">build targets in a trenchcoat</a> – libs,
bins, tests, benches, and so on. In The Build Graph these different build targets get
their own nodes. In The Package Graph all those targets gets merged together into one
big node. The Build Graph is always a proper DAG, but The Package Graph can have cycles.</p>
<p>Thankfully these cycles can only be created by one specific (and rare) situation:
dev-dependencies. <strong>A test/bench target for a package is allowed to indirectly
depend on the same package’s lib/bin target, and this creates apparent cycles
in the package graph!</strong> That’s it!</p>
<p>As we’ll see, <strong>simply ignoring all dev-dependency edges eliminates all cycles
<em>and</em> preserves the ordering constraints of the dependency graph.</strong></p>
<h2 id="an-example-cyclic-workspace"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#an-example-cyclic-workspace">§</a>An Example Cyclic Workspace</h2>
<p>As a concrete example, consider <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde">the serde workspace</a>, which
actually has this “problem”: there’s a “cycle” between serde and serde_derive.
In normal builds this cycle doesn’t exist: serde_derive is actually a standalone
crate, while <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/blob/072145e0e913df7686f001dbf29e43a0ff7afac4/serde/Cargo.toml#L17-L18">serde (optionally) pulls in serde_derive as a dependency</a>.
The “cycle” only appears when testing serde_derive: <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/blob/072145e0e913df7686f001dbf29e43a0ff7afac4/serde_derive/Cargo.toml#L29-L30">serde_derive’s tests quite
reasonably depend on serde</a> to test the proc-macro’s output,
creating a cycle!</p>
<p>The way to resolve this monstrosity is to realize that the tests for serde_derive
are actually a completely different binary from the serde_derive <em>library</em>. Let’s
call those tests serde_derive_dev. So although the (Package) graph reported by Guppy
(and cargo-metadata) looks like a cycle:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>serde &lt;-----+
  |         |
  |         |
  +--&gt; serde_derive
</code></pre></div>
<p>In actuality, serde_derive_dev breaks the cycle and creates a nice clean DAG
(in The Build Graph):</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>  +-- serde_derive_dev
  |          |
  v          |
serde        |
  |          |
  |          v
  +---&gt; serde_derive
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s the really important thing to notice: serde_derive_dev is actually a <em>root</em>
in The Build Graph, and this is always true! Nothing should ever depend on the <em>tests</em>
or <em>benchmarks</em> for another library.</p>
<p>This is the key insight to ignoring dev-dependency edges. As we’ll see, the roots
(and leaves) of a DAG are in some sense “ignorable” by the rest of the graph,
because they can’t change the ordering constraints between other packages.</p>
<h2 id="topological-sort-is-great-and-composable"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#topological-sort-is-great-and-composable">§</a>Topological Sort Is Great (And Composable)</h2>
<p>Now that we understand <em>why</em> cycles can happen in the package graph, let’s look at
what those cycles mess up, and how to deal with them.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons everyone loves DAGs is because you can get a Topological
Sort of them. Topological Sort
(with <a href="enum.DependencyDirection.html#variant.Forward" title="variant guppy::graph::DependencyDirection::Forward"><code>DependencyDirection::Forward</code></a>)
is just a fancy way of saying “a list where packages always appear before their dependencies”
(vice-versa for <a href="enum.DependencyDirection.html#variant.Reverse" title="variant guppy::graph::DependencyDirection::Reverse"><code>DependencyDirection::Reverse</code></a>).</p>
<p>This is really convenient! If you need to do things in “dependency order” you can just
topologically sort the packages and then boring old for-loops will magically get
everything done before it’s needed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t get the Topological Sort of a graph with cycles because that
doesn’t make sense. And yet, Guppy has
<a href="struct.PackageSet.html#method.packages" title="method guppy::graph::PackageSet::packages">several APIs which do exactly that</a>.
What gives? The docs say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The packages within a dependency cycle will be returned in non-dev order. When the
direction is forward, if package Foo has a dependency on Bar, and Bar has a cyclic
dev-dependency on Foo, then Foo is returned before Bar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We just ignore the dev-dependency edges! Problem Solved.</p>
<p>But isn’t this throwing out important information that could change the result? Nope!</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous section, all dev-builds are roots in The Build Graph.
Ignoring all dev-dependency edges is equivalent to deleting all of those roots.
This may “orphan” dependencies that are only used for dev-builds, but we still
keep them in the graph and properly include them in the sort.</p>
<p>As it turns out, you can recursively compute the topological sort of a graph as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>delete a root (or leaf)</li>
<li>compute the topological sort of the new graph</li>
<li>append the root (or leaf) to the start (or end) of the list</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Even although we delete all the dev-nodes from the graph when doing our sort,
if you want to “add them back” the only thing you need to do is handle them before
(or after) everything else!</strong> Even better: all the dev-builds are roots at the same
time, so you can process them in any order!</p>
<p>Just remember that every node with dev-dependencies is really two nodes: the “normal”
version without dev-dependencies, and the version with them. Exactly how you want
to express that notion in your code is up to you. (Two different loops is the simplest.)</p>
<h2 id="reasoning-about-cycles-strongly-connected-components"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#reasoning-about-cycles-strongly-connected-components">§</a>Reasoning About Cycles: Strongly Connected Components</h2>
<p>Ok but wait, none of that involved Strongly Connected Components! Yeah, isn’t that great? 😄</p>
<p>Oh you still want to “know” about the cycles? Then we’ve gotta bust out the heavy
general-purpose machinery. Thankfully the problem of cycles in directed graphs is
an old and well-studied problem with a conceptually simple solution: hide the cycle
in a box and pretend that it’s just one Really Big Node in the DAG.</p>
<p>Yes, really, that’s all that Strongly Connected Components are. More precisely, SCCs
are defined to be maximal sets of nodes such that “every node in an SCC can reach
every other node in that SCC” (a property which definitely holds for cycles).
The reason for this more complicated definition is that you can have a bunch of
cycles all knotted together in a nasty ball, and trying to tease out individual
cycles isn’t really helpful. So we just wrap the whole ball of nodes up into one
big “I give up” box and forget about it!</p>
<p>Now, what does this get us?</p>
<p>The graph <em>between</em> Strongly Connected Components is <em>always</em> a DAG, so you can
always topologically sort <em>that</em>. In really nasty cases this is just vacuously
true (all the nodes end up in one SCC, and so the “Graph of SCCs” is just one big
unsorted node). On the other hand, if the graph already <em>is</em> a DAG then each node
is its own SCC, and so we lose nothing. In this way SCCs give us a way to preserve
all the <em>nice</em> parts of our graph while also isolating the problematic parts
(SCCs with more than 1 node) to something self-contained that we can handle specially.</p>
<p>In the general case, nothing more can be done to order an SCC. By definition every
node depends on every other node! But as we’ve seen in the previous section, there
actually <em>is</em> a good way to order packages even with cycles, and so we maintain
that ordering for our SCCs: it’s just the topological sort with all the
dev-dependencies ignored.</p>
